	<p>
		<strong>The main goal of Mission Software</strong> is to
		<strong class="red-text"
			>build free websites, web apps, and/or mobile apps for Christian
			ministries</strong
		>.
	</p>
	<p>
		While not all projects will be 100% free, Mission Software aims to never
		charge for labor.
	</p>
	<h3>In-House software</h3>
	<p>
		Mission Software may also build projects of our own to <span
			class="red-text">further the Gospel of Jesus Christ</span
		>, raise funds, or more.
	</p>
	<h3>Other qualifying organizations</h3>
	<p>
		Although Mission Software focuses on Christian ministries, other
		organizations may be considered as well.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is at the sole discretion of Mission Software whether or not an
		organization is accepted as a client.
